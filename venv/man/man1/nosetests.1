.SH DESCRIPTION
nose collects tests automatically from python source files,
directories and packages found in its working directory (which
defaults to the current working directory). Any python source file,
directory or package that matches the testMatch regular expression
(by default: \fI(?:^|[b_.\-])[Tt]est)\fP will be collected as a test (or
source for collection of tests). In addition, all other packages
found in the working directory will be examined for python source files
or directories that match testMatch. Package discovery descends all
the way down the tree, so package.tests and package.sub.tests and
package.sub.sub2.tests will all be collected.

Within a test directory or package, any python source file matching
testMatch will be examined for test cases. Within a test module,
functions and classes whose names match testMatch and TestCase
subclasses with any name will be loaded and executed as tests. Tests
may use the assert keyword or raise AssertionErrors to indicate test
failure. TestCase subclasses may do the same or use the various
TestCase methods available.


.SS Selecting Tests
To specify which tests to run, pass test names on the command line:


.nf
nosetests only_test_this.py
.fi
Test names specified may be file or module names, and may optionally
indicate the test case to run by separating the module or file name
from the test case name with a colon. Filenames may be relative or
absolute. Examples:


.nf
nosetests test.module
nosetests another.test:TestCase.test_method
nosetests a.test:TestCase
nosetests /path/to/test/file.py:test_function
.fi
You may also change the working directory where nose looks for tests
by using the \-w switch:


.nf
nosetests \-w /path/to/tests
.fi
Note, however, that support for multiple \-w arguments is now deprecated
and will be removed in a future release. As of nose 0.10, you can get
the same behavior by specifying the target directories \fIwithout\fP
the \-w switch:


.nf
nosetests /path/to/tests /another/path/to/tests
.fi
Further customization of test selection and loading is possible
through the use of plugins.

Test result output is identical to that of unittest, except for
the additional features (error classes, and plugin\-supplied
features such as output capture and assert introspection) detailed
in the options below.


.SS Configuration
In addition to passing command\-line options, you may also put
configuration options in your project\'s \fIsetup.cfg\fP file, or a .noserc
or nose.cfg file in your home directory. In any of these standard
.ini\-style config files, you put your nosetests configuration in a
\fB[nosetests]\fP section. Options are the same as on the command line,
with the \-\- prefix removed. For options that are simple switches, you
must supply a value:


.nf
[nosetests]
verbosity=3
with\-doctest=1
.fi
All configuration files that are found will be loaded and their
options combined. You can override the standard config file loading
with the \fB\-c\fP option.


.SS Using Plugins
There are numerous nose plugins available via easy_install and
elsewhere. To use a plugin, just install it. The plugin will add
command line options to nosetests. To verify that the plugin is installed,
run:


.nf
nosetests \-\-plugins
.fi
You can add \-v or \-vv to that command to show more information
about each plugin.

If you are running nose.main() or nose.run() from a script, you
can specify a list of plugins to use by passing a list of plugins
with the plugins keyword argument.


.SS 0.9 plugins
nose 1.0 can use SOME plugins that were written for nose 0.9. The
default plugin manager inserts a compatibility wrapper around 0.9
plugins that adapts the changed plugin api calls. However, plugins
that access nose internals are likely to fail, especially if they
attempt to access test case or test suite classes. For example,
plugins that try to determine if a test passed to startTest is an
individual test or a suite will fail, partly because suites are no
longer passed to startTest and partly because it\'s likely that the
plugin is trying to find out if the test is an instance of a class
that no longer exists.


.SS 0.10 and 0.11 plugins
All plugins written for nose 0.10 and 0.11 should work with nose 1.0.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR\fR\fR, \fB\-\-plugins\fR\fR
Output list of available plugins and exit. Combine with higher verbosity for greater detail


.TP
\fB\-v\fR\fR=DEFAULT\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR\fR=DEFAULT
Be more verbose. [NOSE_VERBOSE]


.TP
\fB\-\-verbosity\fR\fR=VERBOSITY
Set verbosity; \-\-verbosity=2 is the same as \-v


.TP
\fB\-q\fR\fR=DEFAULT\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR\fR=DEFAULT
Be less verbose


.TP
\fB\-c\fR\fR=FILES\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR\fR=FILES
Load configuration from config file(s). May be specified multiple times; in that case, all config files will be loaded and combined


.TP
\fB\-w\fR\fR=WHERE\fR, \fB\-\-where\fR\fR=WHERE
Look for tests in this directory. May be specified multiple times. The first directory passed will be used as the working directory, in place of the current working directory, which is the default. Others will be added to the list of tests to execute. [NOSE_WHERE]


.TP
\fB\-\-py3where\fR\fR=PY3WHERE
Look for tests in this directory under Python 3.x. Functions the same as \'where\', but only applies if running under Python 3.x or above.  Note that, if present under 3.x, this option completely replaces any directories specified with \'where\', so the \'where\' option becomes ineffective. [NOSE_PY3WHERE]


.TP
\fB\-m\fR\fR=REGEX\fR, \fB\-\-match\fR\fR=REGEX\fR, \fB\-\-testmatch\fR\fR=REGEX
Files, directories, function names, and class names that match this regular expression are considered tests.  Default: (?:^|[b_./\-])[Tt]est [NOSE_TESTMATCH]


.TP
\fB\-\-tests\fR\fR=NAMES
Run these tests (comma\-separated list). This argument is useful mainly from configuration files; on the command line, just pass the tests to run as additional arguments with no switch.


.TP
\fB\-l\fR\fR=DEFAULT\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR\fR=DEFAULT
Activate debug logging for one or more systems. Available debug loggers: nose, nose.importer, nose.inspector, nose.plugins, nose.result and nose.selector. Separate multiple names with a comma.


.TP
\fB\-\-debug\-log\fR\fR=FILE
Log debug messages to this file (default: sys.stderr)


.TP
\fB\-\-logging\-config\fR\fR=FILE\fR, \fB\-\-log\-config\fR\fR=FILE
Load logging config from this file \-\- bypasses all other logging config settings.


.TP
\fB\-I\fR\fR=REGEX\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-files\fR\fR=REGEX
Completely ignore any file that matches this regular expression. Takes precedence over any other settings or plugins. Specifying this option will replace the default setting. Specify this option multiple times to add more regular expressions [NOSE_IGNORE_FILES]


.TP
\fB\-e\fR\fR=REGEX\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\fR\fR=REGEX
Don\'t run tests that match regular expression [NOSE_EXCLUDE]


.TP
\fB\-i\fR\fR=REGEX\fR, \fB\-\-include\fR\fR=REGEX
This regular expression will be applied to files, directories, function names, and class names for a chance to include additional tests that do not match TESTMATCH.  Specify this option multiple times to add more regular expressions [NOSE_INCLUDE]


.TP
\fB\-x\fR\fR\fR, \fB\-\-stop\fR\fR
Stop running tests after the first error or failure


.TP
\fB\-P\fR\fR\fR, \fB\-\-no\-path\-adjustment\fR\fR
Don\'t make any changes to sys.path when loading tests [NOSE_NOPATH]


.TP
\fB\-\-exe\fR\fR
Look for tests in python modules that are executable. Normal behavior is to exclude executable modules, since they may not be import\-safe [NOSE_INCLUDE_EXE]


.TP
\fB\-\-noexe\fR\fR
DO NOT look for tests in python modules that are executable. (The default on the windows platform is to do so.)


.TP
\fB\-\-traverse\-namespace\fR\fR
Traverse through all path entries of a namespace package


.TP
\fB\-\-first\-package\-wins\fR\fR\fR, \fB\-\-first\-pkg\-wins\fR\fR\fR, \fB\-\-1st\-pkg\-wins\fR\fR
nose\'s importer will normally evict a package from sys.modules if it sees a package with the same name in a different location. Set this option to disable that behavior.


.TP
\fB\-a\fR\fR=ATTR\fR, \fB\-\-attr\fR\fR=ATTR
Run only tests that have attributes specified by ATTR [NOSE_ATTR]


.TP
\fB\-A\fR\fR=EXPR\fR, \fB\-\-eval\-attr\fR\fR=EXPR
Run only tests for whose attributes the Python expression EXPR evaluates to True [NOSE_EVAL_ATTR]


.TP
\fB\-s\fR\fR\fR, \fB\-\-nocapture\fR\fR
Don\'t capture stdout (any stdout output will be printed immediately) [NOSE_NOCAPTURE]


.TP
\fB\-\-nologcapture\fR\fR
Disable logging capture plugin. Logging configurtion will be left intact. [NOSE_NOLOGCAPTURE]


.TP
\fB\-\-logging\-format\fR\fR=FORMAT
Specify custom format to print statements. Uses the same format as used by standard logging handlers. [NOSE_LOGFORMAT]


.TP
\fB\-\-logging\-datefmt\fR\fR=FORMAT
Specify custom date/time format to print statements. Uses the same format as used by standard logging handlers. [NOSE_LOGDATEFMT]


.TP
\fB\-\-logging\-filter\fR\fR=FILTER
Specify which statements to filter in/out. By default, everything is captured. If the output is too verbose,
use this option to filter out needless output.
Example: filter=foo will capture statements issued ONLY to
 foo or foo.what.ever.sub but not foobar or other logger.
Specify multiple loggers with comma: filter=foo,bar,baz.
If any logger name is prefixed with a minus, eg filter=\-foo,
it will be excluded rather than included. Default: exclude logging messages from nose itself (\-nose). [NOSE_LOGFILTER]


.TP
\fB\-\-logging\-clear\-handlers\fR\fR
Clear all other logging handlers


.TP
\fB\-\-with\-coverage\fR\fR

Also look for doctests in files with this extension [NOSE_DOCTEST_EXTENSION]


.TP
\fB\-\-doctest\-result\-variable\fR\fR=VAR

Enable plugin IsolationPlugin: 
Activate the isolation plugin to isolate changes to external
modules to a single test module or package. The isolation plugin
resets the contents of sys.modules after each test module or
package runs to its state before the test. PLEASE NOTE that this
plugin should not be used with the coverage plugin, or in any other case
where module reloading may produce undesirable side\-effects.
 [NOSE_WITH_ISOLATION]
